  # IMPORTANT: app/subscriptions/update webhook configuration
  # ============================================================
  # The app/subscriptions/update webhook CANNOT be registered in shopify.app.toml
  # because it is automatically registered by Shopify for Managed App Pricing apps.
  #
  # Shopify automatically sends webhooks to: /webhooks/app/subscriptions/update
  # when subscription status changes (created, updated, cancelled, etc.)
  #
  # We have TWO endpoints that handle subscription updates:
  # 1. /webhooks/app/subscriptions/update - Automatically registered by Shopify
  # 2. /api/webhooks/subscriptions - Custom endpoint for backend integration
  #
  # Both endpoints use the same handler logic and will:
  # - Verify webhook signature (HMAC)
  # - Process subscription data
  # - Automatically allocate plan credits when trial ends
  # - Update subscription metafields
  # - Log all activities for debugging
  #
  # To use /api/webhooks/subscriptions endpoint, you must register it via:
  # - GraphQL Admin API (webhookSubscriptionCreate mutation)
  # - OR Shopify Partner Dashboard (App setup > Webhooks)
