  # IMPORTANT: app/subscriptions/update webhook configuration
  # ============================================================
  # The app/subscriptions/update webhook is NOT configurable in shopify.app.toml
  # because it is automatically registered by Shopify for Managed App Pricing apps.
  #
  # Shopify automatically sends webhooks to: /webhooks/app/subscriptions/update
  # when subscription status changes (created, updated, cancelled, etc.)
  #
  # The webhook handler is implemented in server/index.js and will:
  # 1. Verify webhook signature (HMAC)
  # 2. Process subscription data
  # 3. Store in cache for fast retrieval
  #
  # No manual configuration needed - Shopify handles webhook registration automatically.
  # Just ensure your server endpoint is accessible at the correct URL.
