  # app/subscriptions/update webhook - for subscription updates and credit allocation
  # This webhook automatically allocates plan credits when trial ends and handles subscription updates
  # Registered via shopify.app.toml - will be automatically set up when you run: shopify app deploy
  # Note: The topic format must be lowercase with slashes (app/subscriptions/update)
  [[webhooks.subscriptions]]
  topics = [ "app/subscriptions/update" ]
  uri = "/api/webhooks/subscriptions"

  # IMPORTANT: app/subscriptions/update webhook configuration
  # ============================================================
  # The app/subscriptions/update webhook is NOT configurable in shopify.app.toml
  # because it is automatically registered by Shopify for Managed App Pricing apps.
  #
  # Shopify automatically sends webhooks to: /webhooks/app/subscriptions/update
  # when subscription status changes (created, updated, cancelled, etc.)
  #
  # The webhook handler is implemented in server/index.js and will:
  # 1. Verify webhook signature (HMAC)
  # 2. Process subscription data
  # 3. Store in cache for fast retrieval
  #
  # Note: We also have /api/webhooks/subscriptions for APP_SUBSCRIPTIONS_UPDATE topic above
  # Both endpoints handle subscription updates, but APP_SUBSCRIPTIONS_UPDATE is the specific
  # topic requested by the backend for automatic credit allocation.
